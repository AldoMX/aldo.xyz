I just installed the [Blog Starter][1] from [Gatsby][2].

I'll treat this blog as an anything-goes blog and I'll be dumping random
thoughts that do not fit the format of Facebook or Twitter.

The only consistency you can expect from this blog is inconsistency,
sometimes I'll be posting stuff about development in English, sometimes I'll be
posting stuff about rhythm games in Spanish and maybe someday I'll post
something in Mandarin because why not? hahahaha. I would love to translate
everything I write, but as you can notice from the barebones install I'm just
going for the basics.

Maybe someday I'll organize these random thoughts into a proper blog, well,
actually I'll definitely separate and translate the stuff about my upcoming
[rhythm game][3] whenever the time comes to build the official website.
